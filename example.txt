Using the Randomized Algorithms technique, build a program in C++ that implements the Randomized Binary Search Algorithm to determine if an integer in a set of integers, using the Las Vegas Randomized Algorithm method

Input Format

The program receives an integer  to be searched in the set of integers  described in the next line.

Constraints

, all elements in .

Output Format

The output of the program will indicate in which index is the number to be searched, with the format: "The element is at the index: i", i will be the value of the index. If the data is not found, the message: "The element is not in the array" will be indicated.

Sample Input 0

10
2 3 4 10 40
Sample Output 0

Element is at index: 3
Sample Input 1

11
2 3 4 10 40
Sample Output 1

Element is not in the array
